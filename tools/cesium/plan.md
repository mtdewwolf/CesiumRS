Batches toward 75% Core, in order. Each module is ported with CesiumJS fixtures before it is marked ported.

Along the way, `core::js_math` made the port's `sin`, `cos`, `log` and the other `Math` functions round exactly as V8's do, after a one-bit difference in `cos` moved a rectangle's bounding sphere.

1. ✅ **Small utilities:** containers, URI and query helpers, typed-array strings, `PixelFormat`, `PixelDatatype`, and Core's enums.
2. ✅ **Polygon and instance foundations:**
   - ✅ earcut 3.2.4 and `PolygonPipeline`
   - ✅ `GeometryInstance` and its Color, Show, Offset and DistanceDisplayCondition attributes
   - ✅ `GeometryPipeline`, including antimeridian splitting of triangles, lines and polylines
3. ✅ **Surface geometries:**
   - ✅ `EllipseGeometry`, `CircleGeometry`
   - ✅ `RectangleGeometry`, `RectangleGeometryLibrary`, `RectangleOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ `PolygonGeometryLibrary`, `PolygonGeometry`, `PolygonOutlineGeometry`, and the coplanar polygon geometries
4. 🟡 **Line and volume geometries:**
   - ✅ `PolylinePipeline`, `PolylineGeometry`, `SimplePolylineGeometry`
   - ✅ `WallGeometryLibrary`, `WallGeometry`, `WallOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ `PolylineVolumeGeometryLibrary`, `PolylineVolumeGeometry`, `PolylineVolumeOutlineGeometry`
   - ⬜ `CorridorGeometryLibrary`, `CorridorGeometry`, `CorridorOutlineGeometry` (next)
5. ⬜ **Terrain helpers:** `HeightmapTessellator`, `TerrainEncoding`

After 75% Core: move the viewer onto `src/core` and redeploy it, then finish the rest of Core and start Renderer and Scene.
