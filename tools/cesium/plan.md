Batches toward **100% Core**, in dependency order. Each module is ported with CesiumJS fixtures before it is marked ported. The 75% milestone is an intermediate checkpoint, not the completion target.

Along the way, `core::js_math` made the port's `sin`, `cos`, `log` and the other `Math` functions round exactly as V8's do, after a one-bit difference in `cos` moved a rectangle's bounding sphere.

1. ✅ **Small utilities:** containers, URI and query helpers, typed-array strings, `PixelFormat`, `PixelDatatype`, and Core's enums.
2. ✅ **Polygon and instance foundations:**
   - ✅ earcut 3.2.4 and `PolygonPipeline`
   - ✅ `GeometryInstance` and its Color, Show, Offset and DistanceDisplayCondition attributes
   - ✅ `GeometryPipeline`, including antimeridian splitting of triangles, lines and polylines
3. ✅ **Surface geometries:**
   - ✅ `EllipseGeometry`, `CircleGeometry`
   - ✅ `RectangleGeometry`, `RectangleGeometryLibrary`, `RectangleOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ `PolygonGeometryLibrary`, `PolygonGeometry`, `PolygonOutlineGeometry`, and the coplanar polygon geometries
4. ✅ **Line and volume geometries:**
   - ✅ `PolylinePipeline`, `PolylineGeometry`, `SimplePolylineGeometry`
   - ✅ `WallGeometryLibrary`, `WallGeometry`, `WallOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ `PolylineVolumeGeometryLibrary`, `PolylineVolumeGeometry`, `PolylineVolumeOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ `CorridorGeometryLibrary`, `CorridorOutlineGeometry`
   - ✅ filled `CorridorGeometry`, including extrusion, surface frames, bounds and shadow volumes
5. ✅ **Terrain helpers:** `TerrainEncoding` and `HeightmapTessellator`, passing the 75% Core checkpoint
6. ⬜ **Terrain data and picking:**
   - ✅ `TerrainProvider` contract, cached grid/edge/skirt indices and geometric errors; `TileAvailability` quadtree ranges and coverage queries
   - ✅ `TerrainPicker`, `TerrainMesh`, and native incremental picker refinement
   - ✅ `TerrainData`, `HeightmapTerrainData`, LERC decoding and native heightmap mesh processing
   - ✅ `QuantizedMeshTerrainData` and native quantized mesh creation/upsampling
   - ⬜ 3D Tiles and Google Earth Enterprise terrain data/processors (service-client batches below)
7. ⬜ **Remaining spatial algorithms:**
   - ✅ `S2Cell`, Hilbert levels above 32 through Cesium's finite numeric bounds, and `ApproximateTerrainHeights` with the pinned lookup table
   - ✅ `RectangleCollisionChecker`, including multi-level R-tree insertion/removal reference cases
   - ⬜ `GroundPolylineGeometry`
8. ✅ **Asset and texture processing:** compressed texture buffers, portable KTX2/Basis decoding/loading, texture packing, vector/GEE decoding and concrete browser image/canvas adapters. Reference fixtures and real Chromium checks pass.
9. ✅ **Resource and execution infrastructure:** requests/errors, scheduling/statistics, resources and typed HTTP operations/retries, trusted servers, workers, proxies and sanitized credits. Reference scheduler fixtures, native HTTP/worker integration and Chromium lifecycle checks pass.
10. ⬜ **Terrain providers and service clients:**
   - ✅ `EllipsoidTerrainProvider`, `CustomHeightmapTerrainProvider`
   - ⬜ network heightmap/quantized and 3D Tiles terrain providers, Google Earth Enterprise metadata and terrain, Ion resources/geocoding, platform clients and world-terrain factories. Bing, Google, Pelias, OpenCage and coordinate geocoders pass deterministic parsing, request construction, attribution and error fixtures.
11. **Contracts and host behavior:** ✅ interpolation/packing interfaces, geometry factories, video bindings and terrain sampling validated; ⬜ screen-space events and text/pin rendering remain. Audit every remaining Core tracker row and validate implementations before claiming 100% Core.

Core remains the priority through 100% of applicable modules. Progress requires implemented behavior and reference validation; placeholder APIs do not count. Existing n/a entries describe JavaScript-specific idioms and must retain explicit Rust replacement notes. The viewer already runs on Core — it was migrated ahead of 100% Core so the two implementations could not drift apart. After Core, proceed to Renderer and Scene.

### Validated partial-module batch

All 35 formerly partial Core implementations and the native KTX2 worker calculation now pass validation. The batch adds 617 pinned CesiumJS cases, native lifecycle/HTTP checks and 23 Chromium checks, including Rust video/worker bindings and packaged WASM codec output. Validation found and fixed short GEE packet decoding, Basis codec configuration/output differences and lost ready terrain results on tile/level errors. See [validation details](docs/core-validation.md).

The remaining 20 Core modules are network terrain providers and metadata/3D Tiles processing, Ion/platform clients and world factories, ground polylines, screen-space input, pins and text rendering. These remain todo; browser adapter work is not used to mark unrelated Core modules complete.
